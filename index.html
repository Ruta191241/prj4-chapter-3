 <p><strong>Yes, I'm a loser </strong> let's hope 3rd try will be lucky :)<br> Yes I 
	 <em> hope </em>this try <em>will be more successful</em>, but I really not sure anymore.
	 <br>This is a really interesting course but motivation can be lost too fast</p>

	 <h2> WHAT DO I DO TO TO NOT FAIL AGAIN </h2>
	 <p>Started reading brief more accurately
		 <br> Started using validator in order to not fail for writing "DOCTYPE" not in capitals
		  <br>Just hoping the best to not fail
